# 1. Introduction
+ Our socialbot is based on a large-scale **ensemble system** leveraging deep learning and reinforcement learning.
+ The ensemble consists of deep learning models, template-based models and external API webservices for **natural language retrieval and generation**.
+ We apply **reinforcement learning** — including value function and policy gradient methods — to intelligently combine an **ensemble of retrieval and generation models**.
