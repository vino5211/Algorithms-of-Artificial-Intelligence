# View of Slot Filling

+ Joint Intent Detection and Slot Filling
  + A Joint Model of Intent Determination and Slot Filling for Spoken Language Understanding，是个joint model，性能良好，相对简单；为什么joint，因为其一在SLU两个任务通常都是必须的，其二两个任务的信息可以相互提升。
  + Joint syntactic and semantic analysis with a multitask Deep Learning Framework for Spoken Language Understanding
  + Domain Adaptation of Recurrent Neural Networks for Natural Language Understanding
  + Exploring the limits of language modeling
  + Character-Aware Neural Language Models
  + Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network Models for Joint Intent Detection and Slot Filling
